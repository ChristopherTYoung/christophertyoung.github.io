            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>My name is Christopher Young. I was born on December 17th, 2003 in Logan, Utah. I was raised in Syracuse, Utah for most of my life. My family and I moved to Layton,
                Utah this year, and not too long after I moved into my apartment in Ephraim, Utah. I graduated from Nuames Highschool on May 20th, 2022. 
                I also participated in the NUAMES Early College Program through Weber State University and graduated with my associates in General Studies. 
                I am currently studying and working toward a bachelor in software engineering at Snow College in Ephraim, Utah. Some of the things I enjoy may include playing video games,
                watching TV shows, anime, and movies, and spending time with friends and family. I plan to write about these things and
                the other adventures in my life on this blog.
            </p>
